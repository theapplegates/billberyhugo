      <description>In June 2017 I&amp;rsquo;ve visited Scotland with my best friend for two weeks. We drove a lot through the beautiful countryside and saw a lot of different animals: cattle, deer, birds, dolphins, and sheep. Sheep everywhere!
At one beautiful camping site, we saw cattle in fog in the very early morning and took a picture of it. The image now has the title &amp;ldquo;Rindviecher im Nebel&amp;rdquo;, a quite funny German phrase that means cattle in the fog.</description>

      <description>With the audio post type you can easily integrate a Spotify, SoundCloud, TuneIn or Mixcloud player to your post.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to embed sound but use a header image you can set it with the featuredImage option in your markdown file.</description>

      <description>Arguing that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don&amp;rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</description>
